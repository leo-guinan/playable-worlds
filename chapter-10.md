# Chapter 10: Schelling and the Discovery of Coordination

Before there are rules, there is recognition.

Before incentives, there are expectations.
Before enforcement, there is salience.

Thomas Schelling understood this before almost anyone else.

## The Question No One Was Asking

By the time Schelling entered the scene, game theory had already done something remarkable.

von Neumann showed how adversaries converge under pressure.

Nash showed how systems stabilize without coordination.

But both assumed something quietly profound:

The game already exists.

Players know:

- what the game is
- what moves are allowed
- what outcomes matter

Schelling asked a different question:

**How do people coordinate when the game is not yet defined?**

## Life Before the Game

Most real coordination problems don't start with rules.

They start with ambiguity.

Where should we meet if we're separated?

Which side of the road should we drive on?

Which standard should we adopt?

Which protocol should become dominant?

Which chain should be "the" chain?

No authority decides first.
No enforcement exists.
And yet… coordination happens.

This is not Nash.
This is something earlier.

## Focal Points

Schelling's most famous concept is the focal point.

A focal point is an outcome that people converge on—not because it is optimal, but because it is obvious.

It is obvious because:

- it is symmetric
- it is culturally salient
- it is historically prominent
- it "feels" natural

People choose it because they expect others to choose it.

This is coordination without communication.

## Why Focal Points Work

Focal points work because humans do something subtle:

They model each other's expectations recursively.

Not:

"What do I want?"
But:

"What do I think you think I will think you will do?"

Schelling made this recursive modeling explicit.

He showed that:

- mutual belief can substitute for enforcement
- expectation can substitute for incentive
- salience can substitute for optimization

This is coordination as a cognitive phenomenon.

## Games That Start Themselves

Schelling's insight explains why some games appear to start themselves.

A standard emerges.

A convention locks in.

A default becomes dominant.

No one voted.
No one enforced.
No one designed it.

The game formed because:

- enough players recognized the same focal point
- and moved toward it simultaneously

This is the birth of a game.

## The Danger of Early Salience

Schelling was not naive.

He understood that focal points are not always good.

They are:

- arbitrary
- path-dependent
- sticky
- often suboptimal

Once a focal point forms:

- switching becomes costly
- coordination is trapped
- better alternatives struggle to gain traction

This is how bad games begin.

## Schelling vs Nash (The Critical Difference)

Nash equilibrium explains:

- why systems don't move

Schelling explains:

- why they moved there in the first place

Nash shows you the trap.
Schelling shows you the entrance.

Together, they explain how entire societies can converge on outcomes no one explicitly chose.

## Schelling and the Metagame

Schelling reveals a new layer of the metagame:

**Game selection happens before game play.**

This is where:

- narratives matter
- symbols matter
- timing matters
- early coordination wins

If you want to design good games:

- you must manage salience early
- or you will inherit it blindly

## From Cold War to Everyday Life

Schelling developed these ideas studying nuclear standoffs.

But they apply everywhere.

Arms races coordinate escalation.

Traffic conventions coordinate flow.

Financial panics coordinate fear.

Social norms coordinate behavior.

Cryptocurrencies coordinate belief.

These are not enforced systems.

They are recognized systems.

## Schelling's Place in the Lineage

Placed in the lineage:

von Neumann formalized adversaries

Nash revealed equilibrium traps

Schelling explained coordination without rules

He is the mathematician of beginnings.

## Why Schelling Matters More Now

In a world of:

- open networks
- permissionless systems
- decentralized platforms
- rapid memetic spread

Schelling dynamics dominate.

The first focal point often wins—regardless of merit.

Understanding this is no longer academic.

It is existential.

## The Question Schelling Leaves Us With

Schelling leaves us with a dangerous insight:

**If coordination begins with salience, who controls what becomes salient?**

And more pointedly:

**What games are we already playing simply because they became obvious first?**

## The Bridge Forward

Schelling explains how games begin.

But once games begin, they attract adversaries.

Expectations invite exploitation.
Salience invites attack.
Coordination invites deception.

To survive, games must withstand observers who want to break them.

That requires a new discipline—one that treats information itself as a battleground.

In the next chapter, secrecy becomes measurable, attackers become explicit, and information enters the game as a conserved quantity.
